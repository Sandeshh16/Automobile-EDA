# Automobile-EDA

## Automobile Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project explores an automobile dataset to understand the relationships between various features such as price, engine size, horsepower, fuel type, and more. The goal is to uncover insights that could be useful for data-driven decision-making in the automotive industry.

## Objectives
- Handle missing values and clean the dataset
- Perform univariate and multivariate analysis
- Understand the impact of numerical and categorical variables on car price
- Visualize key relationships using graphs and plots
  
 ## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

 ## Key Findings
- Cars with larger engine sizes and horsepower tend to be more expensive
- Fuel type and body style have a moderate impact on price
- Some brands (e.g., Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche) show higher average prices than others

 ## Visualizations
The notebook includes:
- Histograms and boxplots for distribution analysis
- Bar charts comparing brands and prices
- Correlation heatmaps
